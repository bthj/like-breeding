\todo{discuss our reasons for not really doing a proper evolution}
Suggestion from Noor:

Rather than scanning the full search space each time, initially create a n sets of images randomly.  When you have chosen to hold one or more images, find the best matching set from those n, as a part of a fitness function, and mate that set with the currently visible set.  Then do mutation by randomly selecting images from the whole space, by some chance p.


Con ->  Can reach a local optimum very quickly:  After two have been mated, the fittest individuals according the new offspring would comprise a very limited search space?

Pros ->  Limits the search space:  Won’t have to scan all images each time.

Maybe we are not evolving anything?  Then make that point.

--> Really how our evolution proceeds:\\
Pop size: 1\\
Gene = Image\\
Genome = Cube / Image set\\
Crossover = Similar\\
Mutate = Random
